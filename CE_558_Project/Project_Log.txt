CE 558 Project Log
==================
1.	Need to extend the Cheddar Simulator to account for the PPNew Algorithm. 
2.	Need to compare the algorithmic performance of PPNew to the traditional algorithms using Cheddar.
3.	Need to show the benefit of using this algorithm in Cloud Computing environments over existing methods. 

Extending Cheddar
-----------------
[ ]	Obtain Cheddar Source Code
[ ]	Capture the source code in GitHub
[ ]	Compile the code as is (to make sure that it works)
[ ]	Study how tasks are managed using the existing infrastructure
[ ]	Add the proposed algorithm to the simulator


Compare Algorithmic Performance
-------------------------------
[ ]	Define a test set of tasks
[ ]	Execute the tasks on all of the existing algorithms available in Cheddar, using the same system setup
[ ]	Compare the utility of all of the algorithms for small threshold ranges
[ ]	Compare the utility of all of the algorithms for medium threshold ranges
[ ]	Compare the utility of all of the algorithms for high threshold ranges

Show the Benefit of the Proposed Algorithm
------------------------------------------
[ ]	Identify real use cases in Cloud Computing for this algorithm
[ ]	Demonstrate real-world cost for using traditional algorithms
[ ]	Demonstrate real-world gain for using the proposed algorithm
